# Propftx Movies
Propftx Movies  is a üé¨ straightforward yet robust movie listing web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. This project caters to both administrators and regular users, offering distinct functionalities and access levels.

The core functionality of Propftx Movies revolves around showcasing a curated list of movies in an intuitive card format, enhancing the user experience. Users are presented with a visually appealing interface that displays essential details about each movie, such as its name, ratings, category, and description.

Administrators have extended privileges within the application. They possess the ability to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) movie entries stored in the backend database. Through dedicated forms and interfaces, administrators can seamlessly manage the movie database, ensuring that it remains up-to-date with the latest releases and information. Authentication and authorization mechanisms safeguard these critical administrative functionalities, ensuring that only authorized personnel can access and modify movie data.

For regular users, the focus shifts to providing a seamless browsing experience. While users lack the ability to modify the movie database, they can freely explore the collection of movies available on the platform. The application's responsive design and intuitive navigation enable users to effortlessly browse through the list of movies, facilitating an enjoyable and engaging experience.

In summary, Propftx Movies is a feature-rich MERN stack application that caters to both administrators and users. With its emphasis on simplicity, usability, and security, it offers a comprehensive solution for managing and accessing movie data in a dynamic and interactive manner. üåüüé•üçø

# Role of Redux
In the "Propftx Movies" application, Redux plays a pivotal role in handling the login and logout functionalities, ensuring efficient state management and seamless user authentication.
When a user attempts to log in to the application, Redux manages the login process by dispatching actions to update the application state accordingly. These actions trigger corresponding reducers, which update the Redux store with the user's authentication status and relevant information, such as authentication tokens or user data retrieved from the backend.
Upon successful login, the Redux store reflects the user's authenticated state, allowing the application to grant access to restricted functionalities, such as creating, updating, or deleting movie entries for administrators.
